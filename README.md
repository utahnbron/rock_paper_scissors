# rock_paper_scissors
This is my Rock Paper Scissors game for The Odin Project Foundations course!
Have fun and good luck!

// This is my pseudocode for Rock, Paper, Scissors (RPS):
// Create a function for computerChoice
    // Computer will randomly choose (1) between rock, paper, and scissors

// Create a function to play 1 round of RPS
    // You will need (2) parameters
    // playerSelection and computerSelection
// return string that declares winner or tie
    // "You win! Paper beats Rock"
    // "You win! Rock beats Scissors"
    // "You win! Scissors beats Paper"
    // "You lose! Paper loses to Scissors"
    // "You lose! Rock loses to Paper"
    // "You lose! Scissors loses to Rock"
    // It's a tie! Play another round"

// playerSelection must be case-insensitive
    // rock, ROCK, RoCk must all work
